                    <p>Many airlines serve Maputo, the capital of Mozambique.
                        Among them
                        Ethiopian Airlines
                        Qatar Airways
                        South Africa Airways
                        Turkish Airlines
                        These companies generally offer flights in 2 stages "departure / hub of the company" then "Hub / Maputo"
                        TAP Portugal can be a significant challenger since it offers a direct flight from Lisbon.
                        As an indication, an average budget of flights for Mozambique will be around 700€ for a return trip for one person.
                        In terms of flight comparator, Google has, for a few years, far surpassed all competition, try it for yourself:

                    <p>Since May 2023, the visa is issued directly upon your arrival at the airport, upon presentation of your passport,
                        which must necessarily be valid for more than 6 months from your arrival date, as well as the famous "accommodation letter"
                        which we will send to you in advance. The process will cost you €10, the authorities will give you a receipt which it is
                        important to keep with you throughout your stay. For a planned length of stay greater than 30 days, do not hesitate to contact us.
